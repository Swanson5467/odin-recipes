    <h1>Pumpkin Pie with Maple Marscapone Swirl</h1>

    <img src = "../images/pumpkinpie" alt = "Finished pumpkinpie with mascarpone swirl" >

    <p>One of my all-time favorite flavor combinations is pumpkin and cream cheese. The contrast
        of spiced pumpkin against cold, tangy cream cheese is a gift I look forward to every fall.
        Whether it's a pimpkin roll with cream cheese frosting, pumpkin muffins, or (my personal favorite)
        pumpkin cheesecake, I've riffed on this match made in heaven countless times without fail.
        This recipe - my favorite trick for turning any pumpkin pie recipe into a show-stopping
        dessert - swaps out cream cheese for swirl of luscious, smooth mascarpone.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Pumpkin Pie Base</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Cheesecake Swirl</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 ounces mascarpone cheese</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons whole milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and place it on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Combine pumpkin puree, condensed milk, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl. Mix until combined and set aside.</li>
                <li>Make the cheesecake swirl: In a medium, microwave-safe bowl stir together mascarpone, milk, maple syrup, and flour.
                    Microwave on high power until the cheese is completely melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Stir the mixture until completely smooth.
                    (This will make swirling easier.)</li>
                <li>Add about two-thirds of the cheese mixture into the pumpkin filling and stir to combine. Pour the pumpkin filling into the
                    pie shell. Spoon the remaining mascarpone mixture on top in about 10 or so dollops. Use a thin knife or toothpick to swirl
                    the cheesecake dollops into the pumpkin pie filling to create a swirl pattern.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until filling
                    is set around the sides but jiggles like jello in the center, erring on the side of undercooking as the pie continues to
                    cook as it cools, 30 to 35 minutes. Turn the oven off, open the oven door, and let cool for one hour in the oven before transferring
                    into the fridge to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool completely before serving.</li>
            </ol>

    <h1>Tiramoussa Semifreddo</h1>

    <p>
        This frozen mouse tastes like tiramisu. It is a decadent, rich dessert that feels airy and 
        light which makes it a great treat to have after a heavy meal. Top with whipped cream, shaved
        chocolate, or a sprinkle of cocoa.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons instant dark roast coffee</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon marsala wine</li>
            <li>¼ pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine egg yolks, instant dark roast coffee, marsala wine, and sugar in a metal bowl and whisk 
                together until smooth.</li>
            <li>Place bowl in the top of a double boiler over lightly simmering water. Whisk constantly until mixture
                thickens and drippings from the whisk form ribbons on the surface that are visible for 1/2 second to
                1 second, about 10 minutes. If you are "brave", you can set the bowl directly over medium-low heat
                and thicken the egg cream that way, but you have to be careful so you don't end up with scrambled eggs.
                This last method is slightly faster and will take about 6 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Gradually add salt and continue to beat
                until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until medium-stiff peaks form.
                Using a spatula, fold in egg yolk mixture until combined. Add half of the egg whites and fold in until
                combined. Then fold in remaining egg whites until well combined. Transfer mixture into small 4 ounce jam
                jars and close with lids.</li>
            <li>Freeze for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ol>

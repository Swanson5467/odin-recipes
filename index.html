    <a href = "recipes/pumpkinpie.html">Pumpkin Pie with Mascarpone Swirl</a>

    <p>One of my all-time favorite flavor combinations is pumpkin and cream cheese. The contrast
        of spiced pumpkin against cold, tangy cream cheese is a gift I look forward to every fall.
        Whether it's a pimpkin roll with cream cheese frosting, pumpkin muffins, or (my personal favorite)
        pumpkin cheesecake, I've riffed on this match made in heaven countless times without fail.
        This recipe - my favorite trick for turning any pumpkin pie recipe into a show-stopping
        dessert - swaps out cream cheese for swirl of luscious, smooth mascarpone.
